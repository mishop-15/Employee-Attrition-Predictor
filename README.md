# Employee-Attrition-Predictor
This repository contains a Python script (employee_attrition_prediction.py) that predicts employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The script utilizes a dataset containing various attributes related to employees such as demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and performance ratings. The goal is to build a predictive model to identify factors influencing employee attrition and provide insights for retention strategies.
Libraries Used :
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Plotnine

How to Run:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Download the dataset (employee_attrition_data.csv) and place it in the same directory as the script.
Run the script by executing python employee_attrition_prediction.py.
The script will preprocess the data, train the logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and save the optimized model as optimized_logistic_regression_model.pkl.
The evaluation metrics and ROC curve will be displayed in the console.
Alternatively, you can directly load the pre-trained model from the file (optimized_logistic_regression_model.pkl) and use it to make predictions on new data.
